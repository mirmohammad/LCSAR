# LCSAR
RADARSAT-2 Synthetic-Aperture Radar Land Cover Segmentation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Accepted: WAAMI2020-ICPR

## Review
In this project, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on SAR images to performe land classification.

## Dataset
SAR images used in this project are private. However the land conver images can be accessed through [Canada's Land Conver dataset](https://atlas.gc.ca/lcct/en/index.html).
